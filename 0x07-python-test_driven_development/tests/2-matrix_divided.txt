2-matrix_divided module
======================

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Test cases:

>>> matrix_divided([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 62], 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

>>> matrix_divided([1, 2, 3], 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0]]

>>> try:
...	print(matrix_divided([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 62, 22], 3))
... except Exception as e:
... 	print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

>>> try:
...	print(matrix_divided([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 62], [12, 22], 3))
... except Exception as e:
... 	print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

>>> try:
...	print(matrix_divided([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 'a'], 3))
... except Exception as e:
... 	print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

>>> try:
...	print(matrix_divided(None, 3))
... except Exception as e:
... 	print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

>>> try:

... except Exception as e:
... 	print(e)
ZeroDivisionError

>>> try:
...	print(matrix_divided([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], "I'm an error"))
... except Exception as e:
